ndndsmoketest - simple-minded program for exercising ndnd
	options: -t millisconds - sets the timeout for recv operations
		 -u hostname - communicate with ndnd using udp
	arguments: ( send <filename> | recv | kill | timeo <millisconds> ) ...
		send <filename> sends the literal contents of the file to the ndnd.
			The file should be in ndnd format.
		recv receives data from ndnd and dumps it to stdout.
			Subject to timeout.
		kill tries to get the ndnd to shut down.
		timeo <millisconds> changes the timeout for subsequent recvs.
	environment variables:
		NDN_LOCAL_PORT as for ndnd
